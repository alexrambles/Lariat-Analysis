# Project Notes #

## Objective: Lariat is trying to make better decisions about the vehicles that they purchase for their national fleet.

### Questions

* Is there a diff between revenue at branches by airports and branches not by airports?

* What are the top rentals at branches near airports vs not near airports

### Assumptions
* Currently when a customer gets in an accident, they don't pay damages.

* Car costs are currently paid monthly.

* All cars are rented at least once within the dataset's range of dates.

* Since we only have the costs from the most recent year, we will assume the costs from the previous year were similar.

* Since we have no data from December, I'm taking an average of the net revenue per month and assuming that December will have a similar net revenue.

### Conclusions
* There is no significant trend in accidents as connected to ages.

* Can't analyze by car type since data doesn't include that information.

* The 2017 Ford Ranger is one of the most popular and the top earning models.

* Other than the '17 Ranger, there is no overlap between the top 5 and bottom 5 rentals and net revenue.

* There are 9 bottom rentals because 7 of them had 12 rentals, and choosing only three to include in the bottom listing would skew the net revenue.

* Peugeot is the only brand that results in a total negative net revenue.2016 Peugeot 207 is actually only costing us 888.88 a year. While that's not a huge amount, cutting this car would only result in savings.

* In the most popular Make (Ford), the Ford Ranger, Mustang, F-Series, and F250 bring the most revenue. Focusing purchasing power on these models that already are hugely popular will allow us to maximize usage and profit.

* In Chevy (2nd most popular make), the Corvette and Express 3500 bring in the most revenue and usage by several hundred thousand.

* In Dodge (2rd most popular make), the Viper and Ram 3500 are the two most popular and profitable.

* In Toyota (4th most popular make), the Tundra and MR2 are the most popular.

* For GMC (5th most popular make), the Yukon, Savanna and Safari models are the most profitable.

## Final Recommendations

* Charge an accident fee.
* Get rid of the bottom five cars (net revenue) to cut costs.
* Invest in the newest year of the top 5 models (net revenue) in the fleet.
